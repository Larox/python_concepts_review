# Difference Between Lambdas and Statements

Lamdbas can have only one expression and returns the result. So since it is
composed by an expression it must be evaluated to determine it value (return).

Statements represent an action to be carry out. In Python, this can be a
"regular function" (def) that creates a function object and binds it to a name and
carry out an action (statement or statements), and a return value is optional.
